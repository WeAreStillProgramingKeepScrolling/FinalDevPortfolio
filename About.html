<p id="paragraph1">Hey, what's up.</p>
<p id="paragraph2">If you're wondering who I am, I am the real WASCH or We are Still Coding Here.
    My real name is Aaron and I am still learning how to code websites. It is taking a little bit but I am starting to understand a lot of the material,
    specifically HTML and CSS. My JavaScript still needs a little work. If you want to know more about me and my work, go to the contacts, resume, and home tabs.
    You can find my socials there. Otherwise, for the most part, I like to relax and game with people. I also like to socialize and strike up a good conversation.
</p>
<p>I like to consider myself as a chill guy who likes to game in his free time and likes to observe the layout of a game and give constructive feedback.</p>
